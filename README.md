# CSharp-Program-Service-Orders

C# program written by William Blevins for CIS 199

This program uses a created class named ServiceOrder to create indivdual service orders and hold relevant data for each one.
The main method constructs six ServiceOrder objects each with different data and declares an array to hold them.
A user defined method is used to first calculate the appropriate cost for each order, then the properties of each order are displayed to the console.
Data for each object in the array is changed, then the DisplayServiceOrder method is run again to calculate and display the data a second time.
